# List of actions
1. Write README.md;
2. Produce video clip of set-up and run;
3. Produce documentation describing set-up and run;
4. Expand README in pdf;
5. Add spaceship operator, remove other in/equality operators where appropriate;
6. Make software re-draw windows properly after being hidden (also investigate intermittent minor initial misdrawing of controls);
7. Make software work in non-demo mode, and save results (in both modes);
8. Make software work with directories as well as with single files.

## Start ECWT_train2, reducing library size by using hierarchical version of k-medians
(need to implement rotation-invariant distance for first stages, then computationally expensive shift- and rotation-invariant distance for last stage)
