# List of actions

## ECWT_train1
### Documentation
1. Write README.md;
2. Produce video clip of set-up and run - first effort made, not entirely satisfactory;
3. Produce documentation describing set-up and run;
4. Expand README content in new pdf;
### Software
1. Add spaceship operator, remove other in/equality operators where appropriate;
2. Make software re-draw windows properly after being hidden (also investigate intermittent minor initial misdrawing of controls);
3. Make software work in non-demo mode, and save results (in both modes);
4. Make software work with directories as well as with single files.

## Start ECWT_train2, reducing library size by using hierarchical version of k-medians
(need to implement rotation-invariant distance for first stages, then computationally expensive shift- and rotation-invariant distance for last stage)
