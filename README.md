# ECWT_train1
We wish to implement software based on the algorithms in the author's University of York EngD thesis. The application described here implements phase one training - building library of "shapes" - paths in three-dimensional acceleration space, recorded using triaxal accelerometers. These paths are encoded as three piecewise polynomial wavelets in this space, allowing the advantages of the scale-invariance of wavelets to be used. This means that motions executed more rapidly or more slowly can be represented by the same shape.

More precisely, we use Equivalence Classes of Wavelet Triplets (ECWTs)
